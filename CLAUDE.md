## General Instructions

- After making code changes, use `yarn check-for-ai` to run type checks and the linter.
- If you have completely finished your work, run `yarn check-all-for-ai` to also execute tests (this may take up to 30 minutes).
- After `yarn check-all-for-ai` passes, commit your changes to the current branch and push.

## Coding Style

- When adding new functions or classes, define them below any functions or classes that call them to maintain clear call order.
